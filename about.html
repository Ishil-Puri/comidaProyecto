			<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p id="content">Hank Shaw, the ecstatic owner of the Best Food In the Bay, was one of the world-renowned astronauts who ventured to Jupiter with his crew on <em>Apollo 18</em>. He was researching nuclear weapons, and caused the big storm on Jupiter through his extensive testing. After his astronaut career, he decided to open a restaurant and serve his fellow people. Hank's restaurant is now #1 in the nation, with a <strong>Zagat</strong> rating since its grand opening, and a five star rating on <strong>Yelp</strong> with the help of his trusty customers. The amazing thing is that he didn't even have to bribe or threaten his clients to earn these ratings! He has over three years of experience with his business, and does an exceptional job of delivering when it comes to serving his good citizens. He has always loved food and wants others to enjoy food too. Hank has equipped his restaurant with state of the art banana slicers. But not only does he make sure that his staff can work with cutting edge technology such as the knife, but he also emphasizes on recycling and composting! Hank Shaw greatly encourages you to visit the Best Food In the Bay.</p>
